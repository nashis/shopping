# Shopping checkout system

This is a JS based application, that calculates the total value of all the items in the shopping checkout, after applying a discount as specified by the rules

## Installation & Running test
Make sure you meet the node version dependency as defined in the package.json

```
npm ci
npm run test
```

## Notes
* Based on the requirements interpretation, the rules config used here is very basic and not optimized for multiple discounts for same product
* Functional approach inline with Javascript programming paradigm, can easily be extended to take command line arguments
* Just a basic script to run the tests, can be extended to include build steps, i.e. lint, minification/obsfucation etc.
